# Face Recognition and Clustering

This repository contains implementations of face recognition and clustering algorithms using various techniques, including classical computer vision and deep learning models.

## Face Recognition with FaceNet Embeddings

### Overview
The `face-recognitionwithfacenet.ipynb` notebook provides an analysis of clusters formed using the embeddings of the VGG16 model. 

### Main Function
The main function, `create_cluster_folder`, takes the input as the folder path of the images and the output directory path to create folders for different identities.

## Face Clustering Using AutoEncoder

### Overview
The `FaceClustering_AutoEncoder.ipynb` notebook implements clustering using an autoencoder on the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset.

## Face Detection Clustering

### Overview
The `face_detection_clustering.ipynb` notebook contains the implementation of classical computer vision techniques to get the similarity measure between images. Clustering is then performed based on these similarity measures.
